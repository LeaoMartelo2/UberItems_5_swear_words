Uber powerful items in vanilla Minecraft!

What is UberItems?

UberItems is a plugin that adds powerful and fun items into your game. These items can perform ease of access actions, give you powerful abilities, and allow you to RULE THE WORLD! The utility of these items is up to server owners, as they can be fun to mess around with on private servers, or could be a fun way to spice up a survival or SkyBlock server!

UberItems Premium features have been made free for everyone! Enjoy :D

Setup (Once Compiled)
Make sure your spigot version matches the supported version(s) for this plugin.
Simply drag the UberItems.jar into your plugins folder.
After installing the .jar file, restart the server.
Using the config in the "UberItems" folder generated by the jar, you can change the default values to your liking. You must restart your server or use "/uber reload" to apply changes.
Be respectful and constructive. If a concept in the plugin is fundamentally flawed in your opinion, explain why so I can work to make it better.
Be fair! Just because you are experiencing a problem, that doesn't mean everyone is. My plugin getting a 1 star review because you had the wrong version of Spigot installed is pretty unfair to me, no?
